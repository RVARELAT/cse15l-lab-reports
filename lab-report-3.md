# Week 5 Lab Report (Find Commands)

## -mtime

```
find technical -mtime -7     
technical/plos/journal.pbio.0020001.txt
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
```
- The -mtime command finds files that we modified in the last 7 days which is what "-7" is for. This is useful to find files we modfied in the last week but can't remember which ones they were.

```
cd technical
find plos -mtime -1
plos/journal.pbio.0020001.txt
```
- When we cd into our technical directory we use the -mtime command to find files we modified in the last day in the plos directory. This is useful when we only want to find files we modified in a certain directory recently.

```
find technical -mtime 0  -mtime -7
technical/plos/journal.pbio.0020001.txt
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
```
- The -mtime command is being used twice here to find files we modified within a range of days. Our example looks for files last modified between 0 days in the past but no more than 7 (this example is kinda useless as this is the same thing as simply using -mtime -7 but for the sake of completing the lab report on time we did this, Therefore, if we were to use +4 instead of 0, this would search for files last modified with more than 4 days in the past, but no more than 7). This is useful when we want to narrow down the files we last modified within a certain range of days. 

## -type 

```
find technical -type d
technical
technical/government
technical/government/About_LSC
technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen
technical/government/Alcohol_Problems
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm
technical/government/Media
technical/plos
technical/biomed
technical/911report
```

- The -type command followed by "d" which stands for directory is listing all the directories, including sudirectories, from ./technical. This is useful if we want to know what directories are we are working with, in this case what directories and subdirectories are from ./technical.

```
cd technical
find government -type f

```
- The -type command follwed by "f" which stands for regular file shows all the regular files in the government subdirectory. This is useful as the government subdirectory includes subdirectories and regular files, using this command helps us distiguish the General files from the subdirectories.

```
cd technical
find government -type d   
government
government/About_LSC
government/Env_Prot_Agen
government/Alcohol_Problems
government/Gen_Account_Office
government/Post_Rate_Comm
government/Media
```
- The -type command followed by "d" shows us all the directories under the government subdirectory. This is useful if we want to know if a subdirectory contains more directories, in this case "government" does contain more directories, if it didn't, we would know this specific directory may only contain regular files.

## -size
```
find technical -size +500
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/Statements_Feb28-1997_volume.txt
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/d01591sp.txt
technical/911report/chapter-13.4.txt
technical/911report/chapter-13.5.txt
technical/911report/chapter-3.txt
```
- The -size command finds files from technical that use more than 500, 512-byte blocks units of space. This is useful if we want to find files that are larger than a certain size.

```
cd technical
find 911report -size -75k 
911report
911report/preface.txt
911report/chapter-10.txt
911report/chapter-11.txt
```
- The -size command in this case is being used on a specific directory (911report) to find files that use less than 75 kilobytes("k"). This is useful if we want to find smaller files in a certain directory. (we can change number or scale indicator for -size command)

```
cd technical
find plos  -size +500c -size -900c
plos/pmed.0020191.txt
```
- The -size command is finding files in bytes (???c???) between a range of 500 to 900 in the directory "plos". This can be very useful if we want to find a file that is between a certain range of size in a certain directory.
